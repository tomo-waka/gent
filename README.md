## Introduction

GenT is a template-based data generator. The generated data is used as test data for software that process such data. You can define data format with a simple text file (referred to as a "template") and obtain the output as text file. It means that both input and output are non-programing interfaces. These features are particularly useful as test data in end-to-end testing situations, rather than in Unit testing.
